## Design
<b>Q</b>: Why I choose Angular?<br>
<b>A</b>: 1. It is easier to implement a lightweight application with Angular comparing with Java. 2. As there is no need for data persistence, this application can be designed as a total front-end application without database or server. 3. Maybe I am more familiar with Java, but if I find some technologies more suitable for my task, I would love to learn it. It won't satisfy me just to complete the work.<br>

<b>Q</b>: What's the design of this application?<br>
<b>A</b>: Basically there are two main components contained in this application. One is the app component, which includes the form used for creating new topic and a topic list. Another is the topic component. Each topic relates to a topic component and data of the topic is stored in the topic model (the in-memory structure). <br>
